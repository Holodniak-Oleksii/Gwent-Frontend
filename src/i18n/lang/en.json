Finding the right balance between attacking and controlling your opponent is crucial, as is knowing when to concede a round to gain an advantage later. Keeping track of resources, predicting your opponent’s strategy, and playing cards based on synergy rather than just raw power will lead to victory. Success comes to those who think ahead and force their opponent to play on their terms.",
